# Live Project Requirements
- **Stories:**
There are 10 predetermined stories in total for you to complete, but you must complete stories 1 through 4 to pass the Live Project.  Keep in mind 4 stories is the bare minimum. The more you get done, the more impressive your app will be on your portfolio! Remember to reach out if you get stuck for too long!
- **Daily Update Email:** 
(Daily)
An email to the Live Project Instructor at the end of your working day that *replaces* the Daily Report in the LMS. It should include a brief summary of what you're working on and include answers to the following questions:
  - What struggles or roadblocks are you working on?
  - What schedule will you be working tomorrow?

- **Code Retrospective:** 
(Each Friday)
A quick discussion during the daily stand-up that explains what was helpful and what was detrimental to productivity and team work flow. These meetings are meant to improve communication and coordination within the team (including project manager). Part of the Agile/Scrum method of Project Management.

- **Code Summaries:** 
(Last Friday of the 2-week sprint)
The code summary is a useful tool for your job search. Think of it as a document that shows the most impressive things you did and learned over the course of the project. Try to gather screenshots and code snippets. Many people choose to use GitHub to organize their retrospective. It is ok to upload code snippets to GitHub,  just <ins>don't upload the entire project</ins>. This is a [link](https://github.com/BenjaminLSchwab/JobPlacementDashboard) to another summary as an example. It is important to get the materials you need from Azure DevOps by Monday, because we may need space for more students. Email LiveProjectDirector@LearnCodingAnywhere.com if you know you will need more time.

- **Final Essay:** 
(Last Friday, found in LMS)
<big>Only do the essay if you are finished with all Live Project Sprints!</big>
In your essay, you should answer the following questions:

  - How was your experience working on a team of software developers?
  - What did you learn from working on a small piece of a larger project in the middle of its lifecycle?
  - What was your final take away from the Live Project? What would you do differently next time?
  - How can you apply what you've learned on the Live Project to your career as a software developer?
