# Live Project Requirements
- **Daily Update Email:** 
(Daily)
An email to the Live Project director at the end of your working day that replaces the Daily Report in the LMS. It should include a brief summary of what you're working on and include answers to the following questions:
  - What struggles or roadblocks are you working on?
  - What schedule will you be working tomorrow?

- **Code Retrospective:** 
(Each Friday)
A quick discussion during the daily stand-up that explains what was helpful and what was detrimental to productivity and team work flow. These meetings are meant to improve communication and coordination within the team (including project manager). Part of the Agile/Scrum method of Project Management.

- **Code Summaries:** 
(Last Friday of the 2-week sprint)
The code summary is a useful tool for your job search. Think of it as a document that shows the most impressive things you did and learned over the course of the project. Try to gather screenshots and code snippets. Many people choose to use github to organize their retrospective. It is ok to upload code snippets to GitHub,  just don't upload the entire project. This is a [link](https://github.com/BenjaminLSchwab/JobPlacementDashboard) to another summary as an example. It is important to get the materials you need from Azure DevOps by monday, because we may need space for more students. Email LiveProjectDirector@LearnCodingAnywhere.com if you know you will need more time.

- **Stories:**
Students must complete their stories up to and including story 4 to pass the Live Project.  The vast majority of students are able to complete more than 4 stories in the given two week time frame. Remember to reach out if you get stuck for too long!

- **Final Essay:** 
(Last Friday, found in LMS)
<big>Only do the essay if you are finished will all Live Project Sprints!</big>
In your essay, you should answer the following questions:

  - How was your experience working on a team of software developers?
  - What did you learn from working on a small piece of a larger project in the middle of its lifecycle?
  - What was your final take away from the Live Project? What would you do differently next time?
  - How can you apply what you've learned on the Live Project to your career as a software developer?

# Branch Naming Conventions
For the sake of readability we have a naming convention to use for all your branches

Branch Naming Format:
XX-####-[short_title]

- XX = Your initials
- \#### = Work Item number
- [short_title] = short title of the Work-Item

---
#PEP8 

- PEP8 is Python's official style guide. 
- PEP8 style syntax is not mandatory to create working code, but it is highly recommended to use these conventions.
- It's a set of rules for how to format your Python code to maximize its readability. 
- Writing code to this specification helps to make large code bases, with lots of writers, more uniform and predictable.  
- The full style guide can be found here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Important naming conventions to remember for this project:
- Classes
   - CapitalWords (upper camel case)
- Functions
   - lowercase, words separated by underscores
- Variables
   - lowercase, words separated by underscores
- Constants
   - all uppercase, words separated by underscores
