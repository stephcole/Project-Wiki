# The AppBuilder9000 Overview
---
This project was built using the Django framework. This project is the interactive website for managing one's collections of things related to various hobbies, as well as API and Data Scraped content for those hobbies.


#Before your Sprint Planning Session
- Please read [Step One](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144kD40TogedXC_IO6YjhrOlXa_Ar_3JzhOjyk3KuCEc/edit?usp=sharing) and [Step Two](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cj-kmw7ppEWJT3V0pXJYF1Oqz-Ilg7Bl9W5ZNuatNzs/edit?usp=sharing)
- Follow the steps in [Setting Up the Project](/Setting-Up-the-Project) 
- Read through the rest of the wiki but do not start on any stories

# Live Project Requirements
- **Stories:**
There are over 20 stories in total for you to complete, but you must complete stories 1 through 4 to pass the Live Project.  Keep in mind 4 stories is the bare minimum. The more you get done, the more impressive your app will be on your portfolio! Remember to reach out if you get stuck for too long!
- **Daily Update Email:** 
(Daily)
An email to the Live Project director at the end of your working day that replaces the Daily Report in the LMS. It should include a brief summary of what you're working on and include answers to the following questions:
  - What struggles or roadblocks are you working on?
  - What schedule will you be working tomorrow?

- **Code Retrospective:** 
(Each Friday)
A quick discussion during the daily stand-up that explains what was helpful and what was detrimental to productivity and team work flow. These meetings are meant to improve communication and coordination within the team (including project manager). Part of the Agile/Scrum method of Project Management.

- **Code Summaries:** 
(Last Friday of the 2-week sprint)
The code summary is a useful tool for your job search. Think of it as a document that shows the most impressive things you did and learned over the course of the project. Try to gather screenshots and code snippets. Many people choose to use github to organize their retrospective. It is ok to upload code snippets to GitHub,  just don't upload the entire project. This is a [link](https://github.com/BenjaminLSchwab/JobPlacementDashboard) to another summary as an example. It is important to get the materials you need from Azure DevOps by monday, because we may need space for more students. Email LiveProjectDirector@LearnCodingAnywhere.com if you know you will need more time.

- **Final Essay:** 
(Last Friday, found in LMS)
<big>Only do the essay if you are finished with all Live Project Sprints!</big>
In your essay, you should answer the following questions:

  - How was your experience working on a team of software developers?
  - What did you learn from working on a small piece of a larger project in the middle of its lifecycle?
  - What was your final take away from the Live Project? What would you do differently next time?
  - How can you apply what you've learned on the Live Project to your career as a software developer?

# Branch Naming Conventions
For the sake of readability we have a naming convention to use for all your branches

Branch Naming Format:
XX-####-[short_title]

- XX = Your initials
- \#### = Work Item number
- [short_title] = short title of the Work-Item

---
#PEP8 

- PEP8 is Python's official style guide. 
- PEP8 style syntax is not mandatory to create working code, but it is highly recommended to use these conventions.
- It's a set of rules for how to format your Python code to maximize its readability. 
- Writing code to this specification helps to make large code bases, with lots of writers, more uniform and predictable.  
- The full style guide can be found here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Important naming conventions to remember for this project:
- Classes
   - CapitalWords (upper camel case)
- Functions
   - lowercase, words separated by underscores
- Variables
   - lowercase, words separated by underscores
- Constants
   - all uppercase, words separated by underscores

#Agile/Scrum Methodology

The Agile/Scrum methodology of development is a popular method of development in the Tech industry.  As such, it is the method we chose to use to develop this project.

Scrum can be thought of as a "framework" designed to help small teams of developers create complex projects. It consists of a small group of developers that that work together in short, sustainable bursts of activity called "sprints", with time for reflection built in. Agile methodology is a development methodology that is based on an incremental approach.

Scrum teams consist of a Scrum master and team members. The scrum master acts as a coach and a facilitator and helps the team learn and apply scrum related agile practices.  The scrum master is available to the team to help remove roadblocks. Team members are responsible for completing user stories that incrementally improve the project.  Team members self-organize to get necessary work done and decide themselves how to do the work.

A "sprint planning" meeting marks the beginning of a sprint. This usually has two parts. The first part is for the team to commit to a set of deliverables for the sprint (What will we do?).  The second part is to identify the tasks that must be completed in order to deliver the agreed upon user stories (How will we do it?).

A daily "scrum meeting" (often called a "stand-up") is held each work day. Most teams choose to hold this meeting at the start of each work day, but this can be adapted to a team's preferences. Daily stand-ups should be brief (around 15 minutes) and pointed. Each participant quickly shares: What tasks they have completed since the last daily scrum, what tasks they expect to complete by the next scrum, and what obstacles are slowing them down; tangents are discouraged.

A "sprint review" is the meeting that ends the sprint. This is the team's chance to show off its accomplishments as well as talk about stories that didn't get finished and why.

A "code retrospective" should be done by each member of the scrum team at the end of a sprint. This is for each team member to consider what they learned during the sprint, what they still need to improve, and how what they learned can be applied in the future.
