## **Introduction**
***
This part of the video explains how to open Dev Tools in Chrome (shortcut `(Ctrl + Shift) + I`) as well as how to change where the tools are docked (right, bottom, left, separate window).  Docking your Dev Tools to the right (or left) gives you an opportunity to easily test page responsiveness (property of a page to look good at different screen sizes) by shrinking and expanding the width of the Dev Tools window.  Lastly, hovering over HTML elements in Dev Tools will highlight those elements on the page viewport.

## **Bug Fixing**

This part of the video shows how to debug a CSS issue on the page using the concepts that were explained.  A useful tool for selecting a specific element on the page is Dev Tool's Selection Tool.  The shortcut for this tool is `(Ctrl + Shift) + C` **Note that changes made in Dev Tools will _NOT_ be saved to your code.  All changes in Dev Tools will be lost when you refresh the page.**

## **Editing the HTML**
***
Change the HTML in Dev Tools to quickly see how that text looks on your page.  Dev Tools allows you to copy, cut, and paste elements on the page.  This can be useful for testing out different layouts of your page or to see how some elements look elsewhere.  You can also write your own HTML directly in Dev Tools.  All of these functions and more can be accessed by right-clicking an element in the HTML section of Dev Tools.
