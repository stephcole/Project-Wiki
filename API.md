# What is an API?
An API is an application programming interface. It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other. The developer creates the API on the server and allows the client to talk to it via HTTP requests. The server then returns a HTTP response containing the requested data.

# HTTP Request
A HTTP request is a text string generated by the client and sent to the server containing the specifications of the resource the client is asking for. A resource is anything that can accessed via the web. The HTTP request communicates which resource a client wants to interact with and how the client wants to interact with it, along with some metadata held in the header related to the request.

The resource the client wants to interact with is communicated through the URL that is sent with the request. For example, if a user entered https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/ into their web browser, the web browser would send a request to the server looking for The Tech Academy resource. This is specifically a GET request. GET requests generally ask for the resource to be returned unchanged. There are other types of requests(POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) but we will only be using a GET request.

Once the client’s request has reached the server, the server will search for and return the information the client is requesting. 

# HTTP Response
An HTTP response is what is sent by a server back to a client in response to an HTTP request. These responses contain a status code and if the request was successful, the requested resource. An example status code for a successful request would be “200” and an example status code for an unsuccessful request would be “404”. Other common status codes include “300” for redirects and “500” for server errors.

HTTP responses also include a message body. For our purposes, we are mainly concerned with the message body which could be a JSON or XML stream.
