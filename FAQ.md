## Version Control Questions:

1. Where did my changes go? I created a new branch and now my changes from my previous story aren't in my new branch.
-This occurs when a new branch has been created before an instructor has had time to merge your previous branch into the master branch. There are two ways to approach this. One way is to merge your previous branch into your current branch or wait until an instructor has merged your previous branch into the master, keep in mind we are not here all the time, so don't feel the need to have to wait. Here are instructions for the first approach(merge the previous branch into the current branch):

There is also a video that can walk you through this:

2. When should I update my master branch?
  -Updating your master branch is important to do to prevent merge conflicts. Good practice would be to update the master branch at least every time you start your new story. 
3. What should I do when I have a merge conflict after I created my pull request?
 -Merge conflicts are common, so no need to worry. Instructors can take care of a merge conflict for you, just let us know. If you feel comfortable enough to try it out your self here is a step-by-step walkthrough on how to solve a merge conflict.

4. What do I do if I forgot to create a new branch for my story card and all my changes were made on my previous story branch? 
-You would still need to create a new branch for your story card. Every story requires a new branch. In this instance, you would need to create a new branch within your story card. Once you do this go over to pycharm and you would need to follow the steps that can be found in the image for question 1. 
5. Why can't I commit and push my changes?
-Most of the time when you get an error when trying to commit and push your changes up, this problem comes back to the branch you are working on. Make sure you are not on the master branch trying to commit and push your changes up. You might need to save your code on notepad++ and paste it into the correct branch(not the master branch). Now you should be able to commit and push your changes up. It is always good practice to make sure you are in your working branch. Working on the master branch is not acceptable in the tech industry. However, if you are on your working branch and are getting an error when trying to commit and push your changes up, go ahead and reach out to an instructor on this issue.
