#Writing your Code Summary
For your code summary, you will need to:
- Create a new repository in Github to store code snippets and screenshots of the work you have completed during your sprint. You can do this by creating files in your repository. Please **do not** push the entire project up to your repository. 
- You will also need to create a README file to tell others(such as hiring managers) about what you did on your live project. Take a look at this [sample code summary](https://github.com/BenjaminLSchwab/JobPlacementDashboard) to get a better idea of what is expected of you. 

A README file should contain useful information about your project and serve as a kind of manual. You should not put every single line of code that you have written in this document. Just the code for key features in your app. If you wish to add all your code, you should do so by creating additional files in your repository.

#Formating your README
1. Start with an introduction, describing what your app is about.
2. Create sections for CRUD functionality, Web Scraping, API, and Front end development. This depends on how many stories you have completed as well. You can refer to [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NuhWe3Sa0RPdyM4bPmrBe--P8V7ri8t5G9OipMEhdGk/edit?usp=sharing) for a template specific to our Python Live Project. It is always a good idea to customize it as you see fit.
