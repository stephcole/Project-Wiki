**Audio Settings:**
- It's a common problem for those not familiar with Discord to have audio issues, whether that's hearing others and/or talking with a mic
- If you're having audio issues the first place to check is the settings, which is the gear icon near the bottom left corner

- Then select Voice & Video to access the voice settings for Discord

- Make sure the Input and Output Device are set to either Default, or your specific devices
  - If you choose Default you'll need to make sure your computer's sound settings have your devices set as the default setting. In the example below, my headphones and microphone are chosen as the Input and Output devices. So if I select Default in Discord it will use my default Input and Output devices.

- Testing your audio settings with the Mic Test in Discord is a great way to troubleshoot where your problem is coming from
