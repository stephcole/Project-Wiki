#After your Live Project
___
After your time on Live Project is complete, you will still have the project on your device. You will be able to continue working on your App and add more detail, polish, and complete any stories you didn't get to during your 2 week sprint.

You are able to take this wiki and it's resources with you. To do so, follow these steps.


# 1. Navigate to the Wiki
    - Click the three dots to the right.
    - Select "Clone wiki".
    - Copy the URL provided.
    - You may need to "Generate Git credentials" so leave this page open.
# 2. Open GitHub Desktop
    - Click "Current Repository" -> "Add" -> "Clone repository..."
    - Click to the URL tab
    - Paste the Wiki's URL then click the blue "Clone" button
    - You may be prompted for credentials. If so, click the "Generate Get credentials"
    - Paste the username and password to continue

#The Result
___
The wiki will be downloaded to the folder specified. Each wiki page will appear on your device as a .md file which stands for “Markdown documentation”. You may notice these are the same format as your repository's README. These files can be opened with a text editor and most IDEs (Visual Studio, VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

**Congratulations!**

You now have the wiki cloned to your device. Story guides, documentation, and tutorial links are now available on your device.
